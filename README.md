# YathzeeGame
This is a yathzee game. It was coded just for fun, the code is therefor not perfect and I am planning to improve the structure. You know how it is when you code something quickly and then it turns into something bigger. 

I cannot promise that I have caught all errors or possible ways to cheat. It was a bit tricky to write the logic behind the scores. 

The game is played in the terminal.

If you do not know what Yathzee is then google it! It is a fun game you play with dies.
